I have started to learn Ionic and started to port my current project.
There are a several cli commands I find useful during development:

{% highlight bash %}
adb logcat | grep -i "console"
{% endhighlight %}

with that command I can see logs from my app
{% highlight javascript %}
console.log('Log me');
{% endhighlight %}
